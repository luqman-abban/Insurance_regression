# Insurance_regression
I have applied a linear regression model to insurance data. The model's MSE and R-square were improved with the Random forest method of regression.

# Insurance Dataset Analysis

## Overview
This project explores an insurance dataset to predict charges using regression algorithms. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), outlier detection, and model training and evaluation.

## Data Preprocessing
- Encoded categorical variables.
- Split the dataset into features (X) and target variable (y).
- Further split into training and testing sets (80/20 ratio).

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized the distribution of age, BMI, children, and charges.
- Identified and retained outliers in BMI, considering their potential relevance.

## Model Training and Evaluation
- Implemented linear regression with an initial R-squared of 0.807.
- Enhanced the model to Random Forest, achieving an R-squared of 0.895.
- Conducted sensitivity analysis to assess the model's robustness.

## Usage
To run this project, ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed. Execute the Jupyter notebooks to reproduce the analysis and model training steps.
